    "# The decision tree algorithm is quite easy to understand and interpret data\n",
    "# Random Forest is a tree-based machine learning algorithm that leverages the power of multiple decision trees for making decisions.\n",
    "# The decision tree model gives high importance to a particular set of features.\n",
    "# But the random forest chooses features randomly during the training process.\n",
    "# Therefore, it does not depend highly on any specific set of features. \n",
    "# This is a special characteristic of random forests over bagging trees. \n",
